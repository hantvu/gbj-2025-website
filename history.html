									<h1>Historical timeline<br />
									of GBJ</h1>
									<p>The Global Business Journalism program at Tsinghua University represents one of the most significant initiatives in international journalism education over the past two decades.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/timeline.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									The Global Business Journalism program was founded on September 17, 2007, as a pioneering partnership between Tsinghua University, the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), and Bloomberg News. It emerged as the first English-language graduate business journalism program on the Chinese mainland and remains the only business journalism master's program in that region. This strategic initiative addressed a critical gap: the need for trained professionals who could explain China's increasingly complex role in the global economy to audiences worldwide.
								</p>
								<p>
									The first cohorts, starting in 2007, enrolled roughly 40 students per year, approximately 20 Chinese and 20 international students, creating a genuinely multicultural learning environment from inception. Rick Dunham, a former White House correspondent and National Press Club president, joined as co-director alongside Chinese academic Nailene Chou Wiest, establishing a pattern of bicultural leadership that continues today. Bloomberg professor Lee Miller became a core faculty member, teaching since the program's founding.</p>
									<p>
										By 2025, the program had:<br>
										- Educated over 550 international graduates from 77 nations across 6 continents.<br>
										- Placed at least 20 graduates at Bloomberg News, with over 80% of those being women.<br>
										- Earned over 100 Bloomberg Market Concepts certifications.<br>
										- Established the world's largest university Bloomberg terminal lab.<br>
										- Received accreditation recognition from the US-based Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC).
