									On a weekday afternoon at Tsinghua University, a discussion unfolds that would be difficult to locate anywhere else. A student from Southeast Asia questions the assumptions behind a market forecast. Another, from Europe, reframes the issue through the language of capital flows and geopolitics. At the front of the room, a former foreign correspondent listens closely, pressing the class to clarify its thinking.</p>
								<p>
									This is a typical moment inside the Global Business Journalism program, known as GBJ – a graduate program founded in 2007 that has quietly become one of the most internationally diverse journalism classrooms in the world.			
									The program was created at a time when China’s economic rise was reshaping global markets, but the world’s understanding of that transformation lagged behind the headlines.
								</p>

								<p>
									Business coverage was often fragmented, driven by short-term data points rather than long-term context. The founders of GBJ believed the gap was not simply informational, but educational. What was missing were journalists trained to explain how China’s economy worked – and why it mattered – across borders, cultures and political systems.
								</p>
								<p>
									From the outset, GBJ was unique. It was the first English-language graduate program on the Chinese mainland devoted specifically to business journalism. Built through a partnership among Tsinghua University, the International Center for Journalists and Bloomberg, it combined academic training with professional newsroom standards and direct access to financial data tools rarely found in universities.
								</p>
								<p>
									Rick Dunham, a former White House correspondent who served as the program’s co-director for nearly its entire existence, recalls that the ambition was deliberately high. The program, he has said, had to be world-class or it would have no reason to exist. It also had to be international not just in name, but in daily practice. Students would come from around the globe, study together in Beijing, and learn to report on business and economics with China not as an abstraction, but as lived experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									That internationalism became the program’s defining feature. Each cohort was intentionally balanced between Chinese and international students, creating a classroom dynamic in which cultural difference was unavoidable, and productive. Discussions were shaped as much by where students came from as by what they studied. Assumptions were tested. Vocabulary was negotiated. Over time, many students say, they learned as much from one another as from their professors.
								</p>
								<p>
									The diversity was not symbolic. Over 18 years, GBJ has enrolled students from 77 countries, forming cohorts that reflect a wide range of media systems, political environments and economic realities. Some students arrived with years of newsroom experience. Others were pivoting from finance, technology or policy backgrounds. The result was a learning environment that resisted uniformity and rewarded curiosity.
								</p>

								<p>
									Professional rigor was built into the structure of the program. Bloomberg played a central role, establishing a Bloomberg Terminal Lab on campus that, at the time, was the largest of its kind in the world. Students learned to navigate financial databases, analyze markets and ground their reporting in data. Business journalism was treated not as commentary, but as a discipline – one that demanded numerical fluency and editorial judgment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lee Miller, a longtime Bloomberg professor in the program, often tells students that GBJ is not solely about producing reporters. It is about teaching people how information moves through the global economy. Graduates have gone on to work in newsrooms, but also in finance, corporate communications, international organizations and public institutions. What unites them is not a job title, he argues, but a shared analytical toolkit.
								</p>
								<p>
									As the program evolved, so did its definition of success. In its early years, students were required to produce traditional academic theses. Over time, those gave way to professional journalism portfolios – reported stories, data projects and multimedia work that reflected real-world standards. For faculty, the shift marked a maturation. Students were no longer training for journalism; they were already practicing it.
								</p>
								<p>
									By its tenth anniversary, GBJ had established a global reputation. Alumni were working at major international and Chinese media organizations, including Bloomberg News, Reuters, CGTN and Xinhua. The program began to appear in academic discussions as an example of how journalism education could function outside Western media hubs while remaining globally engaged.
								</p>

								<p>
									Yet the story of GBJ is not only institutional. It is personal. Students describe the pace as relentless: presentations, group projects, deadlines that arrive in quick succession. Many speak of the challenge of finding their voice in a room where no single cultural perspective dominates. Time management, more than reporting, often becomes the first hard lesson.
								</p>
								<p>
									At the same time, the pressure produces its own sense of community. A late-night debate that stretches past the syllabus. A group project that forces unlikely collaborations. A moment, during a presentation or a reporting trip, when a student realizes they belong in the field they are learning. These experiences, alumni say, linger long after graduation.
								</p>
								<p>
									By 2025, the scale of the program is visible in numbers: 18 cohorts, more than 550 graduates, alumni spread across six continents. But those figures only suggest the deeper network that has formed – one sustained by mentorship, professional ties and a shared educational experience that few other programs replicate.
								</p>
								<p>
									Hang Min, co-director of GBJ, often describes the program in three terms: global, business-oriented and journalistic. For her, the emphasis on storytelling remains central. Journalism skills, she argues, are increasingly relevant beyond newsrooms, in any field that requires clarity, verification and ethical communication.
								</p>
								<p>
									As media has changed – print declining, digital platforms fragmenting audiences, artificial intelligence entering newsrooms – the program has adapted. Students are trained to think across formats, not to master a single medium but to understand how stories travel and how technology reshapes both production and responsibility.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Class of 2025 embodies that transition. Their reflections anchor the multimedia project that accompanies this story: interviews that move from uncertainty to confidence, from cultural adjustment to professional clarity. They speak candidly about imposter syndrome, collaboration and ambition. In doing so, they reveal the program not as an abstract institution, but as a lived experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									In an era of polarized narratives and compressed attention spans, GBJ’s relevance lies in its insistence on depth. It suggests that understanding global business – and China’s role within it –requires more than speed. It requires time, context and people trained to listen across differences.

								</p>
								<p>
									Eighteen years after its founding, the Global Business Journalism program remains what it set out to be: a bridge. Between China and the world. Between data and narrative. Between continuity and change. Its story is ongoing, shaped by each new cohort that steps into the classroom and adds another perspective to the conversation
